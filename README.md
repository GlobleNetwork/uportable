# uPortable - Work in Progress
### Rapid Prototyping Progress Web Application
uPortable is a React Progressive Web App being built to "tighten" the feedback loop between the uPort's community and the product development team. On the horizon is token support, peer-to-peer attestations, transaction historiees and more.

We need your help. Understanding all the use cases. Decentralized applications and blockchain technology is complex. At the end of the day we want to help developers ship products that connect to the Ethereum blockchain decentralized identity solutions. 

Design and develop the perfect self-sovereign identity mobile app. Checkout active bounty candidates.

## Fast User Feedback Loops
You know what's sucks? When it's really hard to get user feedback on new application features. User testing can be a big investment. Especially testing feature using compiled Android/IOS apps.

Let's solve that problem.

Progressive web applications are good candidate for solving this problem. A progressive web application (PWA) can be installed on smartphones just like a native application. Minus the compiling and submitting to an app store thing though. Because of this user testing becomes magnitudes easier - product research can be done quickly and efficiently. 
 
A progressive web app (PWA) dramatically decreases the resoures investment required for comprehensive user testing. And user testing  is essential when building a product to match market demand. So that's awesome and cool!

## Install The Progressive Web Application
The progressive web application will be available for developers and beta testers. Developers can easily push new versions of the application directly to a URL, where Beta Testers can quickly and easily install the application. 

Interviews and product research can easily be conducted with limited barriers for mobile app installation.

### Developers
Developers can install the development environment and run a local Webpack dev server to get started.

```
$ npm install -g truffle

-------- Step 1 --------
git clone git@github.com:uport-project/uportable.git ; cd uportable

-------- Step 2 --------
npm install || yarn

-------- Step 3 --------
npm run build || yarn build => development
npm run start || yarn start => production
```

### Beta Testers
Beta testers download the PWA directly from a site URL - https://kamescg.github.io/uportable
